# Intelligent-Farming
The project here mainly deals with the providing the users
with a crop prediction mechanism where the users are shown the best possible crop
that can be cultivated on the basis of input given by the user.
**Isolation Forest** anomaly detection algorithm is used in order the predict the crop using the 5 parameters which include : soil type,start season, elevation of field, pH value of soil and the average temperature of the surrounding.

A research paper was also published on the basis of the project in IJATCSE(International Journal of Advanced Trends in Computer Science and Engineering).

Note: The parameters taken are only test based, hence adding more parameters will improve the efficiency of the system.
